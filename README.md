## Description
This application allows a user to search Google Books through the Google Books API. Search results are rendered in a list of books containing the title, author(s), a description, and book cover image. Users can view a book or save a book. The saved books page renders books that have been saved to the database. Saved books can be viewed or deleted from the list.
